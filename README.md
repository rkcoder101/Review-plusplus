# Assignment Management Platform

This project is a comprehensive **assignment management system** designed to streamline the process of distributing, submitting, reviewing, and tracking assignments in any collaborative settingâ€”be it a classroom, club, or organization. The platform supports both individual and team-based workflows, making it flexible for a variety of educational and professional environments.

## Key Features

- **Assignment Creation:**  
  Admins or authorized users can create assignments, set deadlines, assign them to individuals or teams, and attach relevant files or subtasks.

- **Team & User Management:**  
  Users can be grouped into teams, and assignments can be allocated to either individuals or entire teams. Team membership and roles (admin, reviewer) are easily managed.

- **Submission Workflow:**  
  Users (or teams) can submit their work, upload attachments, and add comments. The system tracks all submissions and their statuses.

- **Review & Feedback:**  
  Reviewers can provide feedback, mark submissions as checked, and mark assignments as completed for each user or team independently. The review process is transparent and auditable.

- **Progress Tracking:**  
  Both users and admins can view pending assignments, submission history, and review history. The platform ensures that completion status is tracked per user/team allocation, not globally.

- **Secure & Scalable:**  
  All sensitive data and configuration are managed via environment variables. The system is containerized for easy deployment and scalability.
